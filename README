# Generating APIs
In this hackathon we will explore creating APIs from documentation and generating documentation from APIs.

The premise is that you are tasked with creating APIs for each table in a database. 
The example data is the AdventureWorks dataset from Microsoft which contains 68 tables.
That amount is way too much to create by hand so we are going to look for a way to generate these basic CRUD APIs.

## Generating API code from Documentation
Using an OpenAPI spec we can generate an API

## Generating documentation from code
Using the API code we can generate an OpenAPI spec to document our API and to let others test it.
