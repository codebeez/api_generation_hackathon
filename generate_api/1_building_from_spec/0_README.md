# Generating an API from an OpenAPI specification
Use the supplied specification to generate a CRUD skeleton in Python.
You can use an online generator or packages such as [FastAPI Code Generator](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi-code-generator/) to generate the code.

JSON and YAML templates are provided for a Person CRUD API. This is based on the person table from the AdventureWorks database.
